Course pojects EE, THU, 2020 autumn

Course: Digital Signal Processing

Project1: DTMF Long Signal Processing

Language: C++

//update on Dec,2,2022
Special Attention for Possible Admission Committee:

This project is what I mentioned in my CV:Analyzed DTMF long signals using FFT algorithm and Goertzel algorithm in C++, and identified the sounds of different telephone keys.

the DTMF-G.cpp, DTMF-FFT.cpp implement the FFT algorithm and Goertzel algorithm in C++.
